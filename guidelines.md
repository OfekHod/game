# Goal

Learn to be better programmers.
You are a good programmer only if you create quality software, period.
You don't necessarily get the required skills to become an excellent programmer at work.
Much of what you do in work is to help the business and it's not always to solve programming problems well.

# Why a game?

* Game is a simulation of a complex system and therefore hard to do. Hard enough to improve our programming skill solving actual hard problems as opposed to the usual nonsense.
* A Game is fun. We all dreamed of making games when we started to program. This will let us make that dream come true



# Technical guidelines

* Focus on the data and the computer first. Code second.
* Absolutely no Frameworks.
* Libraries and other dependencies are trouble. Each *Library* will be carefully evaluated. Use as less libraries as possible. (e.g. use libpng instead of SOIL)
* Implement everything as simple as possible. Simple is in terms of understanding what happens in the computer. (Give image example)
* Build and tests must run *fast*. We want fast feedback and spend our limited time improving the game
* Stick to c mostly using c++ for small stuff.
* No Over engineering. Definitely no OOP (private and stuff). Waiting a while even before splitting to functions.
* Be specific, not generic. Make a game engine specific to our games. Solve problems we have, not all the problems in the world.
* Use plain text files with a goal-specific format as much as possible
* Data Driven. When we code we do it adjacent to *real* data 
* Don't be afraid of rewrites. After you write something once you know it better, if we have a better design it's a good idea to rewrite
